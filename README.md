# Enervator

A cryptocurrency stablecoin, with the currency code EOR, whose aim is to incentivise energy efficiency.

You can read some of the details as to how Enervator works by reading [About Enervator](/ABOUT.md).

_*Enervator is described in more detail in [Steve Huckle's PhD Thesis](https://glowkeeper.github.io/PhDWorks/). Some of the text here borrows excerpts from that work._

_**The name Enervator is a reference to the token's relation to energy. The word 'enervator' is a noun meaning 'something that enervates', where 'enervates' is a verb, meaning to weaken. So in this context, the token aims to decrease energy consumption._

## Deployed Address

Enervator is deployed at address [0x5483b2996BBa07330E188Fe10BB101d4c1Ac8530](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/token/0x5483b2996bba07330e188fe10bb101d4c1ac8530) on Ethereum's Rinkeby Test Network.

## Demo Applications

There are two demo' applications for showcasing [Enervator](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/token/0x5483b2996bba07330e188fe10bb101d4c1ac8530):

1. [Eneradmin](http://bcd1e0c422401c3591fb3a347aaa0d73b7faff797a21b15edabf0ca214157ccb)
2. [Enerchanger](http://798f9d3be8842ddc87a29dd1d04619e48d2d6eeaf7e27f728022e308c2c770fd)

[Eneradmin](http://bcd1e0c422401c3591fb3a347aaa0d73b7faff797a21b15edabf0ca214157ccb) is a tool for administering [Enervator](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/token/0x5483b2996bba07330e188fe10bb101d4c1ac8530). You do not have permissions to set any parameters with [Eneradmin](http://bcd1e0c422401c3591fb3a347aaa0d73b7faff797a21b15edabf0ca214157ccb), but you will be able to read both the token's parameters and any exchange rates that have been specified.

[Enerchanger](http://798f9d3be8842ddc87a29dd1d04619e48d2d6eeaf7e27f728022e308c2c770fd) is a proof of concept that simulates depositing cash and buying EOR, the [Enervator](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/token/0x5483b2996bba07330e188fe10bb101d4c1ac8530) token. To use the tool, first deposit some cash (imagine that's a PayPal link or some such like), then use that deposit to buy some EOR.

### Demo Dependencies

To use [Eneradmin](http://bcd1e0c422401c3591fb3a347aaa0d73b7faff797a21b15edabf0ca214157ccb) and [Enerchanger](http://798f9d3be8842ddc87a29dd1d04619e48d2d6eeaf7e27f728022e308c2c770fd), you will need to be running [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/) with the [Dat P2P Protocol](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/dat-p2p-protocol/) and [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) extensions installed. [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) should be pointing at the Rinkeby Test Network, and you will need a few test Ether in your [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) wallet - you can get those from the [Rinkeby Faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/).

For [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) to see the [Enervator](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/token/0x5483b2996bba07330e188fe10bb101d4c1ac8530) tokens you've bought, you will need to add the [token's contract address]((https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/token/0x5483b2996bba07330e188fe10bb101d4c1ac8530) to your [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) account. To do so,  within [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), go to your account's menu, click on _Add Token_, then specify the custom address _0x5483b2996bba07330e188fe10bb101d4c1ac8530_ - if you've done that correctly, [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) will find the token's symbol and precision automatically.
