## Bitcoin's High Energy Demand

Buried deep within my 2016 paper [Socialism and the Blockchain](http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fi8040049), were some calculations of the 2014 total energy consumption of mining on the [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) network. I estimated that as 3.38 terawatt-hours (TWh); to put that in context, the 2.72 million people of Jamaica used 3.03 TWh of electricity that same year.

During 2018, newspapers began noting Bitcoin's high energy demand ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/17/bitcoin-electricity-usage-huge-climate-cryptocurrency), [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/shermanlee/2018/04/19/bitcoins-energy-consumption-can-power-an-entire-country-but-eos-is-trying-to-fix-that/), [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/07/09/why-bitcoin-uses-so-much-energy)). By the time [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-018-0152-7) published an article about that demand in early November 2018, I  was moved to reply; I did so with my piece for [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/bitcoins-high-energy-consumption-is-a-concern-but-it-may-be-a-price-worth-paying-106282). There, I acknowledged the high energy consumption of cryptocurrencies, but argued that the decentralised architecture of the technology underpinning Bitcoin, the blockchain, could help create models of production that countered the hierarchies of Capitalism. Thus, such energy use was a price worth paying, because it offered an alternative to a system that was creating many problems, not least, climate change. Besides, I argued that, if we were to avoid dramatic change, we needed to move to cleaner energy sources. If we did, humanity would benefit, and as a by-product, so would Bitcoin.

Also buried deep within [Socialism and the Blockchain](http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fi8040049) was an idea for a cryptocurrency I called MarxCoin, which linked its value to the amount of energy consumed by the [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) network, a blockchain technology that is similar to Bitcoin. I argued that  MarxCoin could support a Socialist society, thus countering Capitalism. I included the same idea in an early draft of my PhD thesis. A colleague who read that first draft thought that was interesting, but the link to energy was even more so! They believed I should develop the idea and devote more than the paltry paragraph I had given it! Hence, [Enervator](https://github.com/glowkeeper/Enervator) was born. It's a cryptocurrency that links its value to the world's total primary energy supply and per capita energy use. It does so in a way that incentivises efficiency - if energy use goes down, [Enervator's](https://github.com/glowkeeper/Enervator) value goes up.

## Summary

Honestly? Although at the time, my article for [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/bitcoins-high-energy-consumption-is-a-concern-but-it-may-be-a-price-worth-paying-106282) was by far the most read piece by a Sussex academic on that platform, I couldn't help worrying that my argument was tenuous, at best. I wanted something more concrete to address the criticisms of the energy consumption of cryptocurrencies. [Enervator](https://github.com/glowkeeper/Enervator) is that.

This presentation introduces [Enervator](https://github.com/glowkeeper/Enervator), demonstrates its value mechanisms, shows how it might be exchanged for a sovereign currency, then discusses some barriers to its uptake.
