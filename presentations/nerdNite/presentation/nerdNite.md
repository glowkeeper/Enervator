## Overview

The _blockchain_ is a distributed, historical record of all data ever recorded on the network

## Key Technology

+ Distributed Systems
+ Consensus
+ Cryptography

## Distributed Computer Systems

+ **Peer-to-peer** - A network where its participants are both resource providers and resource requesters
+ **Decentralised**
	+ Architecturally
	 	+ Fault tolerance
		+ Attack resistance
		+ Collusion resistance
 	+ Politically - Control is not ceded to one individual or organisation
+ **Distributed** - A decentralised system that is logically centralised

## Consensus

Protocols that define how global agreement is reached in a distributed system

## Cryptography

The mathematics of information security.

+ **Public-key Cryptography (PKC)** - A form of encryption that creates a public key, which is shared, widely, and a private key, which is known only to the owner
+ **Cryptographic Hash Functions** - Maps arbitrary data to a unique fixed-size string
+ **Digital Signatures** - Identity authentication that allows users to digitally sign their messages

## Bitcoin

Bitcoin is called a _cryptocurrency_ because it is a form of electronic currency that relies on cryptographic techniques. It was introduced in Satoshi Nakamoto's white paper, [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System ](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)

## The Purpose of Bitcoin

[Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) is a peer-to-peer network whose overriding purpose is the propagation of any _transactions_ requiring validation

## Transactions

Transactions are owners of _Bitcoins_ transferring ownership. New owners can authorises those transactions' ongoing transfer, forming a chain of ownership - a _blockchain_

## Transactions (cont'd)

Paying with [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) means creating a record of a new _transaction_

## Blocks

## Mining (Consensus)

_Miners_ on the network [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) use computing power to solve computationally intensive cryptographic puzzles that verify _blocks_ of transactions using _Proof of Work_ consensus. The process is known as _mining_ because the network rewards the P2P node that successfully solves that problem with 'mined' [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/). Hence, mining is also the process by which the system adds new coins to the network.

## Mining (cont'd)

The block is broadcast so that network nodes can decide on its validity

## Ethereum

Key blockchain features _plus_ **programmability** in the form of _smart contracts_, which are autonomous scripts that represent verifiable application logic on the blockchain. [Enervator](https://github.com/glowkeeper/Enervator) takes advantage of that ability

  int128 TPESFactor = ABDKMath64x64.div(values.oldTPES, values.currentTPES);
  int128 prePrice =  ABDKMath64x64.div(TPESFactor, values.perCapitaEnergy);
  values.unitValue = ABDKMath64x64.mul(prePrice, values.pricePerMWh);
